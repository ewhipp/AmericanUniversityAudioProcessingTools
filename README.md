# Audio Processing Tools

This repository is a collection of work that was started by William Brent and Erik Whipp in the Spring of 2018 as a part of an independent study at the American University in Washington, DC.

The repository serves as a learning resource for those looking to learn more about audio processing, GUI development, and software development. The aim of this repository is not necessarily commercial in nature but academic. All code should be documented thoroughly and if it is insufficient, please create a request for further information.

Although in its infancy, the end goal for this project is to create a suite of audio processing tools that can be used as a part of any audio engineer's arsenal of processing power. With that in mind, there are several instances where the project currently lacks:

* UI designers
* Machine learning engineers

The integration of these skillsets would allow for a more involved approach to these processors and give more educational value to the project as a whole. If you are interested in joining the project, please contact Erik Whipp via email.

Finally, these tools are free to use and will always be free to use.
